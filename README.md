## Content
This repository contains the source code for my blogs that benefit from having the whole code included in one place. This is not needed for all blogs, as for some using gists to inlcude code snippets is sufficient.

## Blogs

### Responsible Concurrent Data Retrieval [blog](https://medium.com/p/80bf7911ca06), [code](https://github.com/karpanGit/myBlogs/tree/master/ResponsibleConcurrentDataRetrieval)
We use asyncio combined with aiohttp to orchestrate concurrent data retrieval from PubChem. Rate throttling is based on an asyncio semaphore.

### Recursive Chemical Reactions [blog](https://medium.com/me/stats/post/c6a0fab95fa0), [code](https://github.com/karpanGit/myBlogs/tree/master/RecursiveChemicalReactions)
We use RDKit to apply chemical reactions recursively. Recursive reactions is a way to fragment a large molecule and examine if its parts match one or more structural pattern.
