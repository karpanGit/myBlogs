## Content
This repository contains the source code for my blogs that benefit from having the whole code included in one place. This is not needed for all blogs, as for some using gists to inlcude code snippets is sufficient.

## Blogs

### Responsible Concurrent Data Retrieval [blog](https://medium.com/p/80bf7911ca06), [code](https://github.com/karpanGit/myBlogs/tree/master/ResponsibleConcurrentDataRetrieval)
We use asyncio combined with aiohttp to orchestrate concurrent data retrieval from PubChem. Rate throttling is based on an asyncio semaphore.

### Recursive Chemical Reactions [blog](https://medium.com/p/c6a0fab95fa0), [code](https://github.com/karpanGit/myBlogs/tree/master/RecursiveChemicalReactions)
Uses RDKit to apply chemical reactions recursively as a means to check if complex structures match a given pattern, e.g. they are peptides.

### Statistical Experiments With Resampling [blog](https://medium.com/p/cb9ad2a5e66b), [code](https://github.com/karpanGit/myBlogs/tree/master/StatisticalExperimentsWithResampling)
Uses permutation tests and bootstrapping to estimate p-values and power in A/B tests.

### From Adaline to Multilayer Neural Networks [blog](https://medium.com/p/e115e65fee3e), [code](https://github.com/karpanGit/myBlogs/tree/master/MultilayerNeuralNetworks)
From adaline to multilayer neural networks.
